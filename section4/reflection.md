## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
When I was able to implement a similar concept, I felt like I could be more productive and actually enjoy the time I was working. Unfortunately, my week was very busy and I didn't have very long sessions to work on homework, so I wasn't able to implement the Pomodoro technique as much as I would have liked to.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
It absolutely helped to set a goal for the study session. Although I didn't always reach the goal desired, it helped me maintain a focus and give a framework for the session.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a representation of something, whereas an array is a collection of data stored in a list. We use objects to model real-life things such as a "mountain." We use arrays to store a list of data (typically similar in nature) such as a grocery list.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class- an Array would be best here because it's a "list," and they are all similar in category.
  * List of states and their capitals- an Object would be best here because were dealing with a list of states, but also a property of each state (the capitals). If it were just a list of states then an array would work better.
  * List of things to pack for vacation- I would use an array here because it is one linear list of similar items.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow- Again I would choose an array because of the singular list of similar things.
  * List of student names and their cohort- Because we are dealing with properties of things (the cohort of each student), I would go with an object here.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake- Like the previous statement, I would pick an object to store the ingredients and amounts of each.
  * All my favorite restaurants- an array is best because we are dealing with a linear list of like things.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I can't help but think that any e-commerce site would use an Object type during checkout. Similar to the banking transaction example, an e-commerce transaction would hold keys such as "amount", "date", "item purchased", etc... I have even purchased items where they include the name of the person processing your order, such as who sent me bike parts. The values for each key may be "$400", "9/03/2021", "new rim for front wheel", "Your order was fulfilled by Ken."  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
The last two exercises were tough for me... the classMethods, and the Tweet. I would love to see a live demo or maybe have the prompts worded differently. I will definitely practice this section more before mod1 starts. I just would like to see this broken down to 5 year old language.
