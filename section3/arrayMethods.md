pop- The "pop" method in an array, removes the last item from the array. For instance, if my array is `var favoriteMonths = ["May", "September", "October", "February"]` and then I state `favoriteMonths.pop();` I can expect the string "February" to be removed from the initial array.

push- The "push" method adds whatever item or items to the end of an existing array. For instance, if my array is `var vegetables = ["corn", "beets", "beans"]` and I use the push feature I can add `vegetables.push("carrots", "broccoli");` and my new array will have "corn", "beets", "beans", "carrots", "broccoli" in it.

shift- The shift method removes the first item in an array. For instance, `var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]` I then use the shift command `numbers.shift();` and the integer "1" should be removed from my array.

unshift- Unshift adds whatever item/s to the beginning of your specified array. For instance, `var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and then I `numbers.unshift(5, 6)` and my new array should look like [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]
