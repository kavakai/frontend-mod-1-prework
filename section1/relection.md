## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- I definitly like that you don't have to be super smart in order to be a *SuperLearner*. The thing I resonated most with is that you just have to be open to learning something at every moment. Being open to the idea that anyone can teach you something helps us stay humble and out of *ego*. I think I incorporate a little bit of each of the SuperLearner habits, however I'm not very good at any one in particular. I need to remind myself that learning is a process and each step of the way adds to the end result. I think just being open and humble to the experience of learning is the most important thing.    

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  -a **string** is any series of characters within a set of matching quotations.
  -an **integer** is any number, including decimals and negative numbers.
  -a **Boolean** is any variable that falls into either *true* or *false*.
  -an **array** in any collection of variables: they can be any data type as well.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- var greeting = "Hello World!"

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- The double backslash is a way to indicate a comment in a JavaScript file. The purpose is to be able to make comments without it affecting the code itself... for instance, If you wanted to make a note about an undefined variable that you wish to return to and define at a later date.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is anything you would like to define. If you wanted to talk about a cat, you would have to define what a cat is and in order to do this we would assign it descriptors in the form of variables.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- I am using the example of YouTube... I can only imagine that they use a lot of *names* in the form of *strings*. They probably also use some form of *array* to list the videos presented on the main page. I believe they also use *integers* in the form of how many *views* each video has had. Most likely all of the data types are being used in some form on the YouTube website.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation is used to connect two or more stings together to form a new string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- I believe there was an example of *airbnb* in one of our lessons and they probably use concatenation when combining the inputs of *place, date, and guests* in order to print out results.   

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- Can I see some real-world examples of how this all applies? I can somewhat get the concepts, but how it translates to a website or app has me lost.
