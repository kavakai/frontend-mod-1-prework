## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
In the video, Carmen brought up the idea that we can have idols or people we look up to, but to be careful not to compare ourselves to them. We create stereortypes and then believe that those stereotypes are reality, which can affect how our mindset is; This is something I am really trying hard to not fall victim to. I have the tendency to compare myself to others and in this particular situation (learning coding), it can be very detrimental to my mindset.
The other idea Carmen discussed was that anyone can learn anything. We aren't born with a specific capacity for learning and once we've maxed out were done. This relates to the first statement for me because coding isn't necessarily for a specific type. I have to be willing and put forth effort in order to learn how to code, but it doesn't mean I can't do it.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Similar to the "super learner" topic, I feel that having an open mind or a beginners mind allows me to remain in the constant state of growth and learning. Also, putting myself in situations that are challenging and force me to get creative or problem-solve (such as signing up for Turing), help me stay in the growth mindset.
As stated above, I could be better at not comparing myself to others. If I see someone that I associate with being smart/knowing the answers, I tend to get into the mindset that I'm not as good or "I can't do this." I also tend to shy away from asking questions when I get stuck or need help.    

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Gmail has to use arrays. We have folders that hold different email collections (such as inbox, sent, archive, etc...) which are most likely stored in arrays for ease and cleanliness.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a way of storing a collection of data in one place. It allows us to group "like" data without having to individually write code for them.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is a way of iterating without having to type out code for every task you wish to complete.
Using a loop with an array is excellent when you have an array that you'd like to iterate through. It allows us to manage a large amount of data without having to go through it all individually.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop would be like buying a pack of gum with different color wrappers for each stick of gum. Instead of pulling out each stick of gum and seeing which colors there are, if we used a loop it would happen for us. We wouldn't have to look at every one and write down the color.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
So far, I think I get this section better than any previous section... although that may be because of the other sections. No questions at this time, although I would still love to actually see these concepts in a "real life" setting.
