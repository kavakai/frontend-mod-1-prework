## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I have a hard time asking questions. I tend to fight my way until I find an answer mostly for fear of not being "smart enough." I did however post a question to my cohorts in our slack channel, which took a while to finally ask.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I can absolutely tell that it's getting harder. I feel like I had to push myself a bit more this section in order to get through it. I am also realizing that I am enjoying the challenge, so I hope I can keep that enthusiasm up.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is when you/your computer is given a choice to make and your decision dictates the outcome. For example, IF I go to the store today, THEN I will have food to make diner. I would say that when websites have input fields, that's a good indicator that there is a conditional statement happening... as in AirBnB when you put in your dates, and location one thing happens, but if you click the "I'm flexible" button, a different thing happens.  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
To add multiple conditions to an "if" statement, you add multiple else/if lines of code. As the computer reads each line, it evaluates the user input and determines if the conditions are met... If the conditions are met then the computer stops reading the code and prints the corresponding code. If the conditions are not met, then the computer continues to the next condition until it evaluates a condition that is met.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
The console on a web app, or running node on your terminal.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Does it occur ever where an if statement is within an if statement?
